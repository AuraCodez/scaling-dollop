Grade Stats Calculator for a class.

How does the program work?

Goal - We need to write a program for printing out grade statistics for a university/school course

Requirements -

The program asks the users for results from different students on the course. These includes
a) exam points and b) number of exercises completed. The program prints out statistics based
on the results.

for example : 15 95

15 exam points and 95 number of exercises completed.

Exam points are integers between 0 and 20 and the number of exercises completed is an integer 
between 0 and 100.

Program keeps asking for input, until the user types in an empty line. 
When the user types in an empty line, the program prints out statistics

Exercises that are completed are converted into a exercise point

Completing 10% of the exercses = 1 point
Completing 20% of the exercises = 2 points
Completing all 100 exercises = 10 points.

The points are an integer value.
